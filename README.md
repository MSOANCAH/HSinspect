The model is based on the random forest algorithm and it predicts both the outcome of a violation and its probability.

## Getting Started

This Python code:
1) creates the SQL database
2) trains and validates the model, optimizing hyperparameters
3) evaluates its performance
4) creates maps of violations by US state

### Prerequisites

This code is Python 2.7 and relies on the following packages:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas
- postgresql
- sqlalchemy
- psycopg2
- basemap

Please ensure these packages are installed before attempting to run this code
